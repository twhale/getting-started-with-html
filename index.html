    <b>Stage 0 Notes – Getting Started with HTML</b>
<br>
<br><b>HTML documents</b> are a key component of internet communications, as it is the language that is passed between the user, the user’s computer, the internet, and the web servers.
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML = Hypertext Markup Language.</b>  HTML translates to text, markup (tags for arrangement), references (images and documents) and links to other locations.  
<br>
<br>
<b>Tags</b> are used to mark the beginning and ending locations for special formatting.  Start and end tags are enclosed in < > 's.
<br>
<br>There are 2 types of HTML tags – inline and block.  Inline tags are used to format a single line of text, whereas block tags are used to define formatting for a section of text, like a paragraph.  
<br>
Image an invisible line drawn around a section where block tags control the style of that entire area.
<br>
<br>
Examples of some Inline tags:
<br>
a - anchor tag; use to define file/locations
<br>
b - makes text <b>bold</b>
<br>
br - line break tag (this is a void tag; it does not require an end tag)
<br>
em - <em>italicizes</em> text
<br>
<br>
Example of a block tag:
<br>
p - paragraph tag
<br>
<br>
<b>Attributes</b> are used with tags to define files and file locations.
<br>
Use attribute <b>href</b> with an anchor tag to define a link to a web page, or <b>src</b> with the img tag to define a location of an image.
<br>
<br>
There are some useful tools for experimenting with HTML that you can use for free on the web:
